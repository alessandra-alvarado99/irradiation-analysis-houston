### Objective: 
This project aims to estimate and compare the annual solar irradiation (kWh/mÂ²) and average daily solar peak hours (HSP) across different zones of Houston, Texas. The purpose is to remotely evaluate the feasibility of photovoltaic system installations without requiring on-site inspections, thus improving initial client confidence.
